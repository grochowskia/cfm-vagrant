# Troubleshooting Tips

After installing VirtualBox on the host "vboxdrv" kernel module is required to start bringing the VMs up via Vagrant. In case you see following error please reboot the host machine to make sure kernel module is loaded properly.


```bash
vagrant status
VirtualBox is complaining that the kernel module is not loaded. Please
run `VBoxManage --version` or open the VirtualBox GUI to see the error
message which should contain instructions on how to fix this error.

or

VBoxManage --version
WARNING: The vboxdrv kernel module is not loaded. Either there is no module
         available for the current kernel (3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64) or it failed to
         load. Please recompile the kernel module and install it by

           sudo /sbin/vboxconfig

         You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.
